/*
  SD card test

  This example shows how use the utility libraries on which the'
  SD library is based in order to get info about your SD card.
  Very useful for testing a card when you're not sure whether its working or not.

  The circuit:
    FOR ESP32 DEVKIT C
    SD card attached to SPI bus as follows:
 ** MOSI - 23
 ** MISO - 19
 ** CLK - 18
 ** CS - 5.
 		MAKE SURE TO REFER TO PINOUT OF THE BOARD TO FIND DEFAULT SPI PINS.
